# Dark dictionary

A dictionary with darkmode and anki support

## Notes

* On opening, the app asks for the location of the dictionary file. You can download this file at dict.cc (use EN -> XX tab-delimited UTF-8).

* Although the app is written in Dart/Flutter, there is no iOS support as the Anki api is written in Java.
